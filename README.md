# EXD-Net: A Framework for Dynamical Memory, Instability, and Transformation

EXD-Net is a computational memory framework that simulates how instability (whether emotional, cognitive, or representational) drives memory drift, transformation, and identity remapping. Each version explores this theme using different architectures and representations.

## Current Release

### [v1_hopfield](./v1_hopfield/README.md)
Uses a classic Hopfield network to model how emotional memory scenes stored as attractors destabilize over time through reinforcement from new associations. This version explores identity shift, memory override, and nonlinear transformation via attractor drift.

---

## Framework Goals

- Model memory as high-dimensional attractor dynamics  
- Simulate instability, memory drift, and transformation over time  
- Create reusable modules for dynamic memory architectures  
- Blend cognitive science and psychological theory with machine learning tools  

---

## Planned Versions

- `v2_traces`: Incorporates Fisher Information and memory trace quantification
- `v3_accumulation`: Explores stochastic leaky accumulation and memory thresholds
